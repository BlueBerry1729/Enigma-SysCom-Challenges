I used Rainmeter to customize my desktop.
I enhanced the default skin - Illustro, by adding backgrounds (previously, the default, being grey). I also changed the font sie and styles, and modified the text on the skins.
I want to be aware of how much space I am occupying in my disks and recycling bin. I also want to be aware of how much of my laptops RAM and CPU I am utilizing, so that I can reduce the burden on my laptop whenever necessary. Hence, I customized my desktop to look the way it is right now.
