### **Level 0: Customize Your Desktop Environment (PS 0.1)**

I have used the in-built themes of my Desktop Environment to change the look and feel.
I have also chnaged to ASCII art logo to make it feel like home.

The background is white so that the logo is more clearly visible.

The wallpaper is a built in titled "CPU" with dims 7680*4380
